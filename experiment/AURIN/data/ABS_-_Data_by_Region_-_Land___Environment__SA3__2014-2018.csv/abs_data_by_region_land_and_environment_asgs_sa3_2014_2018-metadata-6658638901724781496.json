This release of Data by Region presents various data for 2014-2018 and is based on the Statistical Area 3 (SA3) 2016 boundaries. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of land and environment: Land Area, Protected Land Areas and Solar Installations.<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1410.0Explanatory%20Notes12014-19?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/> AURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n<ul><li>Spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1410.02014-19?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.001Main+Features10018July%202016?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) SA3 2016 dataset</a>.</li><li>Some data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.</li><li>Where data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.</li><li>Columns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.</li></ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"yr","type":"Integer","title":"Year","description":"Year.","stype":"nominal","categories":[{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2017","label":"2017"},{"key":"2018","label":"2018"}],"filterValue":"2018","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa3_code_2016","type":"String","title":"SA3 Code","description":"SA3 Code (ASGS 2016).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"land_area_land_area_ha","type":"Double","title":"Land Area Land Area (ha)","description":"Land Area Land Area (ha).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa3_name_2016","type":"String","title":"SA3 Name","description":"SA3 Name (ASGS 2016).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"slr_instlltns_accmltve_ttl_2001_incrse_pnl_frm_prvs_yr_pc","type":"Double","title":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Increase in solar panel installations from previous year (%)","description":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Increase in solar panel installations from previous year (%).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"slr_instlltns_accmltve_ttl_2001_incrse_wtr_htr_frm_prvs_yr_pc","type":"Double","title":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Increase in solar water heater installations from previous year (%)","description":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Increase in solar water heater installations from previous year (%).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"slr_instlltns_accmltve_ttl_2001_smll_scle_pnl_systm_nm","type":"Integer","title":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Small-scale solar panel system installations (no.)","description":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Small-scale solar panel system installations (no.).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"solar_installations_accumulative_total_2001_water_heater_num","type":"Integer","title":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Solar water heater installations (no.)","description":"Solar Installations - Accumulative Total from 2001 Solar water heater installations (no.).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[144.317,-38.533,145.546,-37.166]},"where":"(yr IN ('2018'))"}}
