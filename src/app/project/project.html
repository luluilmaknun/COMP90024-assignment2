    <h2>Cluster and Cloud Computing Assignment 2</h2>
    <h2>Melbourne the Most Liveable City…?</h2>

    <h3>Assignment Description</h3>
    <p>
        The software engineering activity builds on the lecture materials describing Cloud systems and
especially the UniMelb Research Cloud (MRC - https://dashboard.cloud.unimelb.edu.au) and its use
of OpenStack; on data from the Twitter APIs, and CouchDB and the kinds of data analytics (e.g.
MapReduce) that CouchDB supports as well as data from the Australian Urban Research
Infrastructure Network (AURIN – https://portal.aurin.org.au). The focus of this assignment is to
harvest tweets from Melbourne on the MRC and undertake a variety of social media data analytics
scenarios that explore liveability of Melbourne and importantly how the Twitter data can be used
alongside/compared with/augment the data available within the AURIN platform to improve our
knowledge of the liveability of Melbourne. Teams can download data from the AURIN platform, e.g. as
JSON, CSV or Shapefiles, or using the AURIN openAPI (https://aurin.org.au/aurin-apis/). This data
can/should be included into the team’s CouchDB database for analysis with Twitter data.
The liveability of a city is based on a set of indicators including housing, neighbourhood, transportation,
environment, health, engagement, and opportunity (see https://livabilityindex.aarp.org/how-arelivability-
scores-determined). The goal here is to explore aspects of liveability through one or more of
these indicators. You are not expected to develop scenarios covering them all.
The teams should develop a Cloud-based solution that exploits a multitude of virtual machines (VMs)
across the MRC for harvesting tweets through the Twitter APIs (using both the Streaming and the
Search API interfaces). A large corpus of historic Twitter data for Melbourne will also be provided.
The teams should produce a solution that can be run (in principle) across any node of the MRC to
harvest and store tweets and scale up/down as required. Teams have been allocated 4 servers
(instances) with 8 virtual CPUs and 500Gb of volume storage. All students have access to the NeCTAR
Research Cloud as individual users and can test/develop their applications using their own (small)
VM instances, e.g., using personal instances such as pt-1234. (Remembering that there is no
persistence in these small, free and dynamically allocated VMs).
The solution should include one or more Twitter harvesting applications for Melbourne, e.g., you may
have one for housing related tweets and one for health-related tweets. Each team member should get
one or more Twitter developer tokens to access the Twitter APIs as accounts are capped. The teams
are expected to have multiple instances of this harvesting application running on the MRC together
with an associated CouchDB database containing the amalgamated collection of Tweets. The CouchDB
setup may be a single node or based on a cluster setup. The system should be designed so that
duplicate tweets will not arise.
